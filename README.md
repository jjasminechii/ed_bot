# ed_bot

This is an EdStem Discord bot designed to help manage and enhance the interaction between students and instructors on the EdStem platform through Discord :)

Current functionalities include:
- *Course Announcements*: Automatically post announcements from EdStem to designated Discord channels.
- *Post Notification*: Sends Discord messages for each new post on Ed (FERPA compliant).
- *Assignment Reminders*: Sending reminders for upcoming assignment deadlines.

My stretch goals in terms of future functionality:
- *Grading Sorting*: Sorting and managing late and on-time student submissions.
- *Grading Checks*: Checking that all on-time submissions are graded and late submissions are ignored.
- *Data Gathering*: Data pulling for completions, stats, and engagement.
